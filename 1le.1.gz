.SH RANGE
Range is a useful expression to select many lines.
There are four types of range.
1. One line: this type of range has only one positive integer.  E.g. “1”, “23”
2. All until: this type of range has only one positive integer after a tilde. E.g. “~4”
3. Between: this type of range has a tilde between two positive integers. E.g “2~5”
4. N after: this type of range has ‘N’ between two positive integers. E.g “3N1”
